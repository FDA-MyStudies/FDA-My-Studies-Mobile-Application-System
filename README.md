# FDA MyStudies Mobile Application System

This repository contains all the necessary code for running the FDA MyStudies mobile applications (iOS and Android), web 
configuration portal (WCP), and storage environment. The mobile apps and WCP were developed by Boston Technology Corporation. 
The registration server and storage environment are extensions of LabKey Server, a platform developed by LabKey and 
available under the Apache 2.0 license. All development occurred under the direction of FDA and the Harvard Pilgrim Research Institute (HPHCI).
